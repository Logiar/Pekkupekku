This is a simple Blazor WebAssembly project, primarily intended for learning/practice.

This means code will for practice rather than implementing "useful" features.
If I do find something I think would be fun to do I might work on adding it, but it will not be aimed at solving any problem other than my inexperience.

If you have any comments about the code (improvements, problems or if I do something "strange") feel free to post an issue.
